	<h4> MIKE'S HISTORY...A BRIEF RUNDOWN</h4>
		<p>The story of how Mike came to be starts with his parents, John and Rosie. Growing up together in Chicago near the Wicker Park area (which was nothing like it is today) filled with poverty, gangs and drugs, John and Rosie were able to "roll out" of the hood and start a life together at a young age. John joined the Marines to help put Rosie through school. Following his tour, he came back home to Chicago, the two were married and had two wonderful boys, John the oldest and Mike (who is slightly <strong><em>cooler</strong></em> than the his older brother).</p>

		<p> Mike attended grammar school in Chicago, Sabin Magnet to be exact, located in Humboldt Park. After that, Gordon Tech High School, followed by Columbia College where he received his Bachelor's Degree and became first person in his family to go on to college and graduate.</p>

	<h4>WHAT'S MIKE UP TO THESE DAYS?</h4>
		<p> Mike is currently doing well in his career. He is a Digital Marketing Coordinator where he strategically plans and designs campaigns to drive revenue for the company he works for. He has decided to take a front end development course to add another skill to the toolbox. He just bought a new home and spends a lot of time building furniture for his new joint, friends and even has a handful of repeat clients who found his work on social media.</p>
